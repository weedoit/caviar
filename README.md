  <strong>keep it simple, elegant and fast!</strong>

###what's this? 
Caviar is a little framework to create Cordova Apps in a simple way and with high performance. 
It was created following some [FastGap](https://github.com/FastGap/fastgap) project techniques. Our main concern is to keep everything simple and fast. 

We have no intention to define standards of design for UI. We only want to provide a flow management system, resources and some other magic.
